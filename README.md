Tokyo Olympic Azure Data Engineering Project
This project demonstrates a data engineering pipeline on Azure, designed to handle, process, and analyze Tokyo Olympic data. It highlights the use of various Azure services for end-to-end data ingestion, processing, transformation, and visualization.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to set up a robust data pipeline to collect, process, and analyze Tokyo Olympic Games data. Using Azure's data engineering tools, we efficiently extract data from diverse sources, transform it to meet analytical requirements, and store it for visualization and reporting. The pipeline showcases Azure's capability to handle large datasets, enabling insights into various aspects of the Olympics such as event statistics, medal counts, athlete performance, and more.

Key Components
Data Sources:
The pipeline ingests data from multiple sources, including flat files (CSV, JSON), APIs, and streaming data sources. The data includes information on athletes, events, countries, medal counts, and more.
Data Lake (Azure Data Lake Storage - ADLS):
Raw data is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage as the central storage repository. ADLS supports scalability and is ideal for handling large volumes of unstructured and structured data. Data is stored in a hierarchical structure, including folders for raw and transformed data.

Data Ingestion (Azure Data Factory - ADF):
Azure Data Factory orchestrates data ingestion, moving data from external sources to ADLS. ADF pipelines are used to automate data ingestion tasks, including data extraction, loading, and transformations, ensuring smooth data flow into the storage layer.

Data Processing (Azure Databricks):
Azure Databricks processes and transforms raw data from ADLS. Using Spark, the data is cleansed, transformed, and prepared for analysis. This stage includes tasks like joining datasets, handling missing values, and data aggregation to ensure data is ready for downstream analytics.

Data Warehouse (Azure Synapse Analytics):
Transformed data is loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics, a powerful analytics service, for data warehousing. Synapse enables efficient querying and analytics over large datasets, allowing complex queries to run smoothly and providing data for further analysis.

Data Visualization (Power BI):
Power BI connects to Azure Synapse to create interactive dashboards and reports. Visualizations allow stakeholders to gain insights into the Tokyo Olympic data, with metrics on medals, athlete performance, country rankings, and event statistics.

Orchestration and Monitoring:
Azure Data Factory manages end-to-end orchestration, triggering pipelines for scheduled data ingestion and processing. Azure Monitor is used to track pipeline performance, alerting on any issues that arise in the data flow.

Key Features
Automated Data Pipelines: Azure Data Factory orchestrates data flow from source to storage, processing, and finally to visualization, creating an automated end-to-end pipeline.
Scalable Data Processing: With Azure Databricks, the project can handle large datasets and complex transformations, leveraging the power of Spark.
Centralized Storage with ADLS: Azure Data Lake Storage serves as a single storage location for raw and processed data, ensuring data integrity and easy access.
Analytical Power with Synapse: Azure Synapse enables efficient data warehousing, making data ready for business intelligence and reporting.
Real-time Insights with Power BI: Power BI dashboards allow stakeholders to analyze and visualize data, driving insights into the Tokyo Olympic games.

Data Flow Summary
Data Ingestion: Data from various sources is ingested using Azure Data Factory and stored in Azure Data Lake Storage in its raw format.
Data Processing: Raw data is processed in Azure Databricks, where it is cleansed, transformed, and aggregated.
Data Storage and Analytics: Processed data is loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics, allowing for fast queries and analytics.
Data Visualization: Power BI connects to Azure Synapse for visualization, enabling real-time insights and interactive dashboards.
